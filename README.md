# DotNet-Keycloak
DotNet-Keycloak app is built on the ASP.NET Core 7 framework and leverages Keycloak's OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication and authorization. OpenID Connect is a widely-used authentication protocol that adds an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution.
